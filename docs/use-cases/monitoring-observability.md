# Monitoring & Observability Automation

## Overview

Autonomous agents that detect, diagnose, and fix data platform issues automatically.

**Problem**: Pipeline failures wake up on-call engineers at 2 AM. MTTR is 2-4 hours.

**Solution**: Agents monitor continuously, diagnose root causes, and auto-remediate safe fixes.

---

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Autonomous Issue Detection
- Continuous pipeline health monitoring
- Anomaly detection (data volume spikes, performance degradation)
- Log analysis and error pattern recognition

### 2. Root Cause Diagnosis
- Multi-turn conversation with logs
- Evidence-based hypothesis ranking
- Historical incident pattern matching

### 3. Automated Remediation
- Safe fixes applied automatically (restart, retry, scale)
- Human approval for risky changes
- Rollback capability

### 4. Incident Learning
- Builds knowledge base from past incidents
- Improves diagnosis accuracy over time

## Example: Self-Healing Pipeline

**Timeline**:
```
02:00 AM - Pipeline starts
02:15 AM - Failure detected (TimeoutError)

[02:15:10] Monitoring Agent: Pipeline failure detected
[02:15:30] Incident Agent: Analyzing logs...
[02:16:00] Incident Agent: Root cause = 4.5x data volume spike
[02:16:30] Incident Agent: Missing partition filter on large table
[02:17:00] Pipeline Agent: Adding partition filter
[02:17:30] Pipeline Agent: Retrying execution
[02:20:00] âœ… Pipeline succeeded

MTTR: 5 minutes (vs. 2-4 hours with human intervention)
On-call engineer: Still sleeping ðŸ˜´
```

## Implementation

See [Framework Comparison](../guides/framework-comparison.md) for implementation details using AI Foundry SDK or Anthropic SDK.

---

## Metrics

- **MTTR**: 90% reduction (10 minutes vs. 2-4 hours)
- **On-call burden**: 80% reduction
- **Pipeline reliability**: 60-80% fewer failures
