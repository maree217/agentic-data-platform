# Cost Optimization & FinOps Automation

## Overview

Autonomous FinOps agents that continuously analyze cloud spend and implement cost-saving optimizations.

**Results**: 30-50% cost reduction through automated waste detection and remediation.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Spend Analysis
- Daily cost monitoring
- Anomaly detection (unusual spikes)
- Cost attribution per team/project

### 2. Optimization Recommendations
- Idle resource detection
- Right-sizing opportunities
- Reserved capacity analysis
- Spot instance recommendations

### 3. Automated Actions
- Scale down idle resources (non-prod)
- Delete unused assets
- Apply cost-saving configurations
- Budget enforcement

### 4. Forecasting
- Predict monthly spend
- Budget alert thresholds
- What-if scenario modeling

## Example: Weekly Cost Review

**Agent finds $15K/month savings**:

```
ðŸ’° Current monthly cost: $45,000
ðŸ“‰ Potential savings: $15,000/month (33%)

Top opportunities:
1. Dev Databricks idle 80% â†’ scale down (-$8K/month)
2. Synapse DW runs 24/7 â†’ pause nights/weekends (-$5K/month)
3. Unused storage snapshots â†’ delete (-$2K/month)

âœ… Auto-applied (non-prod): $10K saved
ðŸ‘¤ Pending approval (prod): $5K
```

## Metrics

- **Cost savings**: 30-50% reduction
- **Waste detection**: Real-time (vs. monthly reviews)
- **Budget compliance**: 95% adherence
